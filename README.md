Currently some of the incooperated features include: 

- Web Speech API üîä
- Dark Mode üåô
- Auto play audio ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- Open source
- Easy to use 

Wanna help improve the functionality of this App? Here is how to get involved. 

## Getting started and Contribution guide

To get started with this project, there are some steps you need to follow:

1. Make sure to read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. **Fork this repository**    
By forking this repository, this will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. This is necessary because you need your own copy to work on the project, so that you have your own remote. *The fork button is located at the top right corner of this page.*
3. **Clone the repository**  
Cloning the repo will allow you to have the project on your local machine. To clone the repo, run the following command in your terminal: `git clone` followed with the URl that points to your forked repo. This URL can be copied by clicking on the green button that says "Code" and copying the URL. 
```bash
git clone <the-url-that-points-to-your-forked-repo>
```
4. **Switch to the repository directory**  
By doing this you will be automatically switched to the project directory. 
```bash
cd learning-english
```
5. **Create a branch**  
By creating a separate branch you are isolating your changes from the main branch. This is a good practice because you can always switch back to the main branch if you want to update your forked repo with the original repo. To create a branch, run the following command:   
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
6. **Make necessary changes and commit those changes**  
After you have created a new branch, you can now make the necessary changes. After you have made the changes, you need to add the changes and commit them. To add and commit all changes, run the following command:   
*Add changes*
```bash
git add .
```
*Commit changes*
```bash
git commit -m "<commit-message>"
```
By default since this is a web app you would want to see if changes you made we rendered correctly, for this you will need to test the project locally first.  

In our case we will need to install all development dependencies of the project using the command:
```shell
npm install
```
and sfterwards start the development mode using tthe command: 
```shell
npm run dev
``` 
This will start your project on `localhost:9090` and you can see if your changes are rendered correctly. ‚ú®

7. **Push changes to GitHub**
Finally if everything turns out fine, you can now proceed to pushing your changes to GitHub. To push your changes, run the following command:   
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
8. **Submit your changes for review**  
If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button. This will open a new page where you can add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution. With that, you have submitted your changes for review. üéâ
